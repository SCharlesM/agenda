A project to help write agendas.

Currently I write agendas by manually writing the time, topic and location in a table in a word processor. If I change the starting time or duration of an item in the agenda I need to manually change all the times.

The Agenda project will allow me to build agendas with Topic names and durations but also easily edit the date, start-time, duration and topics and automatically change the times
