A project to help me write agendas.

Currently I write agendas by manually writing the time, topic and location in a table in a word document. If I change the starting time or duration of an item in the agenda I need to manually change all the subsequent times for the whole agenda.

The Agenda project takes an excel file with; Agenda Title, Agenda start-time, Session titles and Durations, and outputs an agenda with the start-time and end-times for each session.
