Version 1 (v1)

A project to help write agendas.

Writing agendas manually involved writing the starting time, end time and title for each session into a table.

If any changes to the start time, order of sessions or duration of sessions needs to happen, the agenda has to be updated and re-written, which can be very time consuming.

The Agenda project takes an excel file 'agenda_input.xlsx' as input. This includes the following information: Title, start time, session title and duration, and outputs an agenda with the start-time and end-times added for each session. 

Usage:
Update the 'agenda_input.xlsx' file with required information and then run from the command line with 'python agenda.py', the output excel file will be in an 'outputs' folder in the local directory with the Agenda title and current date and time stamp. eg 'new_agenda_11_11_2024_9.00PM.xlsx'
