Version 1 (v1)

A project to help me write agendas.

Currently I write agendas by manually writing the starttime, endtime and topic in a table in a word document.

If I change the starting time or duration of an item in the agenda I need to manually change all the subsequent starttimes and endtimes for the whole agenda, which can be very time consuming.

The Agenda project takes as input an excel file 'agenda_input.xlsx', including; Agenda Title, Agenda start-time, Session titles and Durations, and outputs an agenda with the start-time and end-times added for each session.
