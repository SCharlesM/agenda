Version 1 (v1)

A project to help me write agendas.

Currently I write agendas by manually writing the starting time, end time and topic for each session in a table in a word document.

If I need to change the starting time or duration of a sessionin the agenda, I need to manually change all the subsequent start times and end times for the whole agenda, which can be very time consuming.

The Agenda project takes as input an excel file 'agenda_input.xlsx', including; Agenda Title, Agenda start-time, Session titles and Durations, and outputs an agenda with the start-time and end-times added for each session.
