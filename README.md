Version 1 (v1)

A project to help write agendas.

Writing agendas manually involved writing the starting time, end time and title for each session into a table.

If any changes to the start time, order of sessions or duration of sessions needs to happen, the agenda has to be updated and re-written, which can be very time consuming.

The Agenda project takes an excel file 'agenda_input.xlsx' as input. This includes the following information: Title, start time, session title and duration, and outputs an agenda with the start-time and end-times added for each session.
