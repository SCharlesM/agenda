A project to help me write agendas

Currently I write agendas by manually writing the time, topic and location in a table in a word document. If I change the starting time or duration of an item in the agenda I need to manually change all the subsequent times.

eg

|Start-time | End-time  | Topic     | 
-------------------------------------
| 10:00     | 10:25     | Intro     |
-------------------------------------
| 10:25     | 10:55     | Topic 1   |
-------------------------------------

The Agenda project will allow me to build agendas with Topic names and durations but also easily edit the date, start-time, duration and topics and automatically change the times
